# ICVR: Internet Computer Virtual Reality 

## Intro 

ICVR the name we give to the collection of tools, assets and workflows that go together to enable the delivery of an on-chain immersive experience. It is the generalised solution that grew out of the iterative development of four unique environments.

It is an open-source, extendable toolkit that offers creative freedom and a method to self-host your VR experience on the blockchain. It aims to lower the technical barrier to the construction of this type of VR framework, running on the Internet Computer's distributed server network.

Here, we are promoting a development pipeline, rather than a platform. We are advocates for a particular development path, one that we ourselves are taking, and we invite you to join us.

## What is this Repo?

This is the first version of the open-source framework. It contains a central test scene, containing only a floor and a network connector.

It is currently provided "as is" and the code is licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/)
